    If you're a media company dealing with a content moderation crisis, join the wait list for the Virian Api. We're launcing late 2021. But let's open a dialogue now

    The purpose of the Virian Project is to help align the consequences of culture with its intetion. Our approach is technical. We are currently gauging the state of culture in various ways through various API's whilest further developing a framework by which to differentiate these. As our proceses are refined, we'll be shifting our resource towards generating data streams for media companies to include in their calculations about what to show people.
