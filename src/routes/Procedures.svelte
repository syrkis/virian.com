    The purpose of the Virian Project is ultimately to help align the consequences of culture with its desires. Our approach is technical. We are currently gauging the state of culture in various ways through various API's whilest further developing a framework to differentiate these on. As these proceses are refined, we'll be shifting our rsources to generate data streams for media companies to include in their calculations about what to show people.
