The <i>Virian Project</i> is an attempt at measuring the effect of media on our collective attention. We want this effect to be a data feature in <code>AI</code>-based media curation systems. The web, increasingly, is our shared nervous systemâ€”we need it to guide our attention in a way that aligns with our values.
