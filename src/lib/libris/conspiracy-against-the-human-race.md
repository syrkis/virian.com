"|Malignantly useless", that is what life is, Ligotti would have you believe, with
his beautiful and disturbing book. However, in the best GÃ¶delian fashion, the work fails to adress its own beauty, thereby leaving readers inappropraitely fond of life with a way out of woe. Indeed, why would such an ugly thesis read so beautifully? Perhaps the meaning lies not in what the text says, but what it feels like to read it....
