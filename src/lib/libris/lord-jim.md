Lord Jim is a tale of guilt, honor, and redemption, penned with Conrad's characteristic insight into the human condition. Our protagonist, Jim, lives in the shadow of a single, disastrous act of cowardice, continuously haunted by his past. His struggle to reclaim his lost honor – amidst the unforgiving realities of life – is a poignant exploration of integrity and identity. Jim's journey, albeit painful, reminds us that it's never too late to strive for redemption.
