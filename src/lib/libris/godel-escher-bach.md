Hofstadter, with his dazzling tour-de-force 'Gödel, Escher, Bach', plunges us into a whirlpool of recursion, self-reference, and the paradoxial miracle of cognition.
The book is a beautifully intricate braid of art, music, and mathematics. It is a masterpiece, of the same caliber as the works of the artists it discusses.
