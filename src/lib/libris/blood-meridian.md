Set in the American West, Blood Meridian is tale of violence, told with perhaps the most beautiful prose ever put to page. It has the texture of scripture, and the tone of a nightmare:
"*[...] and not again in all the world’s turning will there be terrains so wild and barbarous to try whether the stuff of creation may be shaped to man’s will or whether his own heart is not another kind of clay.*"
