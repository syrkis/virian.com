Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" is a chilling critique of the horrors of colonialism, more akin to a fever dream than a work of fiction.
Through the hazy, hallucinatory journey of Marlow into the depths of the Belgian Congo, Conrad paints a deeply unsettling portrait.
This portrait seems to have implications for the entire world....
With its dense narrative and haunting symbolism, this novel demands to be unpacked, yet its underlying message is brutally clear;
the world is a bad place. On the positive side, it will make you utterly discusted by colonialism and slavery.
So, for those of you that are interested in having the "right" opinions, but haven't quite figured out how to get there, this will do the trick."
