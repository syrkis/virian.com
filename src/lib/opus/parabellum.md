As global security continues to deteriorate [@smith2024], the scrutiny of military strategy becomes increasingly important. In addition to improving strategic quality, the scrutinizability of military strategy can also be expected to increase public trust in military decision-makers. To that effect, Parabellum is an open-source warfare simulation framework. Based on JaxMARL's SMAX [@rutherford2023] and supported by Armasuisse, the framework advances military scenario modeling through parallelization and environmental realism.

## Key Features

1. Open-source: Encourages community contributions and transparent development.
2. Parallel simulations: Enables running multiple environments simultaneously.
3. Environmental modeling: Incorporates rasterized terrain and obstacle interactions.

## 1. Open-source

Parabellum can be installed as a `Python 3.11` package with `pip install parabellum` in your shell. The code repository is located at [github.com/syrkis/parabellum](https://github.com/syrkis/parabellum), where issues can be added or resolved by anyone. If you make a project using Parabellum, please consider adding it to the Parabellum [README](https://github.com/syrkis/parabellum/blob/main/README.md).

## 2. Parallelization Capabilities

Parabellum's core strength lies in its ability to run numerous simulations concurrently, using `vmap` and `pmap` from JAX [@frostig2018], for thousands or millions of parallel environments respectively. This implementation facilitates robust statistical analysis and efficient exploration of varied scenarios.

## 3. Environmental Modeling

Raster-mask matrices can be fed into the environment scenario. We provide an Open Street Map based function that, given any place on Earth, constructs a mask-matrix where each entry (pixel) represents one meter. Parabellum, however, supports the use of any matrix of ones and zeros as an obstacle map.

## Research Implications

1. Comprehensive strategy scrutinization through multiple parallel simulations.
2. Enhanced tactical doctrine testing via high-fidelity environmental modeling.
3. Potential for novel machine learning approaches in strategy optimization.

Parabellum's open-source nature and parallelization capabilities provide researchers with a powerful tool for advancing military strategy research, while necessitating careful consideration of ethical implications.
