Parabellum is a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for Command & Control simulation. It is a heavly modified version of JaxMARL's [@rutherford2023] SMAX, a StarCraft II like JAX based environment. Parabellum includes notions of fog of war, civilians, friendly fire, obstacles, and other elements that are common in military operations.

 The environment is designed for extreme scalability, with the ability to simulate millions of agents through thousands of parallel environments. The code is located in the [github.com/syrkis/parabellum](github.com/syrkis/parabellum), and is under active development.
