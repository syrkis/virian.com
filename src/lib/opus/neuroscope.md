Perhaps our most complex project, Neuroscope is an ongoing exploration of the human brain. In exploring biological neural networks, the project serves as a vehicle for both developing and using thir most cutting edge artificial counter partsâ€”graph neural networks, neuroevolution, multiomodality, and more. Based on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) by @allen2022, which consits of 70,000 image-fmri response pairs, the project is developing encoding and decoding mappings between visual corteces and visual inputs.^[this is an example of a footnote thor could use for citation.]

Ultimately, the Neuroscopy project consists of 2 varibles: `x`: a 100 dimensional vector encoding a specific image, and `y`: a vector of varying dimensions encoding the brain's response to a given image, and four function:

$$
f(x) \rightarrow z \qquad
g(z) \rightarrow y' \qquad
h(y) \rightarrow x'
$$

## Dataset and Methodology

Our work primarily relied on the Algonauts Project 2023 dataset by @gifford2023. This dataset contains fMRI scans from the NSD that capture the brain's responses to various images from the COCO dataset by @lin2015. We used these responses to train our model, integrating advanced deep learning methods, and the categorical information contained within each image.

## Model Architecture

Our primary model is constructed of four interconnected sub-modules, each tasked with handling a slice of the image and predicting a different output. Alongside this, we tested a secondary model to check the potential usefulness of multimodality.

## Techniques and Tools

To tune our hyperparameters, we used Bayesian optimization. We also implemented a cross-validation strategy, which provided us with robust estimates of our model's performance and its optimal hyperparameters. Furthermore, we incorporated an auxiliary task within our primary model: the prediction of categories during training.

## Early Findings

So far, our results indicate that integrating additional modalities might boost the performance of a brain encoding model during inference. This could potentially lead to significant advancements in neural decoding.

## Further Information

The GitHub repository for this project is available here for those interested in exploring further, and our training logs can be found on Weights & Biases.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your interest in our project. We've attempted to simplify our approach for this overview, but for those seeking a more detailed, technical explanation, we recommend going through the original report.
