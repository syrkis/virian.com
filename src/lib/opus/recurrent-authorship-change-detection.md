title: Recurrent Authorship Change Detection
description: Siamese and recurrent neural networks are used here, to detect changes in authorship in consecutives paragraphs of text, akin to finding fingerprints in prose. Authorship change detection is used in forensics, cybersecurity, literary research, and more.

In the era of Morse code, experienced operators were identifiable by the rhythms and patterns of their telegraphy. The idiosyncrasies of a writer, too, seep through their prose, leaving an indelible mark of identity.

An author's prose is their symphony—their choice of words, narrative pacing, and sentence construction make up the distinctive notes. The melodies of meaning and harmonies of style coalesce into a complex composition, unique and telling. Each piece of writing, thus, emerges as an integral part of an elaborate linguistic concert, where notes of ideas, words, and voice resonate together.

To discern the subtle signatures echoing within this symphony, we turn to the maestros of pattern recognition: machine learning and its powerful neural networks. Like perceptive musicologists, these networks traverse the melody lines, detecting subtle changes in style—each indicative of a different composer.

Our orchestral guides in this endeavor, the Siamese Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), are akin to discerning listeners attuned to every note and rhythm. The MLP picks out individual motifs, identifying variations that hint at a change in authorship. The GRU, with a broader ear, listens for shifts in the overarching melodic structure, distinguishing where one composer's contribution ends and another begins.

As the models attune themselves to these individual compositions, we refine and calibrate them. This process of 'hyperparameter optimization' is much like fine-tuning an instrument to strike the perfect note. With careful adjustment, our models learn to recognize the subtleties of each author's 'literary melody'.

Identifying an author from their prose, much like recognizing a composer from their music, requires a keen ear for both the individual elements and the way they blend together. The notes of an author's voice, the melody of their style, and the rhythm of their thinking, together form a symphony. By learning to recognize these unique signatures within the symphony of language, we not only unmask the author but also gain a deeper understanding of the rich, multifaceted nature of written expression.
