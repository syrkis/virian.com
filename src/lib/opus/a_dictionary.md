# A Dictionary

1. A straight line can be drawn between any two points
2. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line
3. Given any point and distance, a circle can be drawn with the point as center and the distance as radius
4. All right angles are equal to one another
5. Given a line L and a point P not on the line, exactly one line can be drawn through P that is parallel to L

These are the axioms of Euclidean geometry. What are their characteristics?
Clarity is frequently attributed to all but the fifth axiom. Indeed,
the mathematically inclined tend to suspect the fifth axiom
might be a theorem of the first four. This puzzled mathematicians
for literally thousands of years. The solution came in the late 19th century,
when mathematicians decided that instead of thinking of the fifth axiom as something
necessary, that should either be an axiom or a theorem (something that follows from a set of axioms),
it perhaps needed not be true at all. And just like that, non-Euclidean geometry was born.
Non-Euclidean geometry is astoundingly common, useful and intuitive. We live on a sphere,
in which the parallel postulate is false. So too is it false in many more abstract, mathematical spaces we frequently encounter. What went wrong? Why did this take two thousand years to solve?

The terms "line" and "point" were too infused with attributes we snuck in from the real world,
without formally noting that. The term "line" and "point" are both objects that Euclid used in
his pure mathematical work, but also things we have real life experience with. This led to a two
thousand year long confusion. If the words "line" and "point" are too loaded with attributes from the real world so as to allow clarity of thought, imagine what calling our functions "neural networks" and saying that they "learn", "forget", "remember", "predict", "evolve", and are "artificially intelligent" might do to our thinking?

In addition to being loaded with attributes (much more so than the words "line" and "point"), these terms are also, unequivocally sexy. Podcast bros will speak of "Artificial Intelligence" and "Neural Networks", but never "Itô calculus" or "Lipschitz continuity". By all means, use these sexy terms if your intention is to be sexy, but when the aim is clarity of thought—your own thought, as well as the reader's—stay away from these terms. I propose a dictionary to help:
