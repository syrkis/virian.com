title: Deep Image Reconstruction From Brain Activity
description: Utilising convolutional graph neural networks to reconstruct images
  from brain activity, this project spans neuroscience, geometric deep learning,
  and network analysis. In addition to being a daunting technical challenge,
  brain decoding holds immense promise for alleviation of neurological
  disorders.
