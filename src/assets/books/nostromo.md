"I'd rather have written Nostromo than any other novel," F. Scott Fitzgerald declared, drawn perhaps to how Conrad transforms a precise geometric space into a moral universe. The opening chapters describe a landscape that seems drafted by a cartographer: a city on a coastline bending in an arc through the sea, with islands mathematically spaced across the watersâ€”distant enough for sound to never reach, but close enough for the fires of revolution to be visible. Unlike the river that pulls Marlow deeper into darkness in Heart of Darkness, here the static precision of the coast and its sentinel islands creates a stage where human chaos will play out, each point on the mathematical arc becoming a potential salvation or snare. There is something meaningless in this initial geometric beauty, but as political upheaval engulfs the land, the very geography becomes charged with the feeling and the moral compromises of those caught in its perfect measurements.

Ranked 47th on Modern Library's 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century list, Nostromo ought to be talked about much more.-->
