Blood Meridian, McCarthy's seminal (anti-)western, has the tone of scripture, but the feel of a nightmare. It is a paradoxical read. The book tells of a world so utterly disturbed that even its atoms seem cruel: "_[...] jagged mountains were pure blue in the dawn and everywhere birds twittered and the sun when it rose caught the moon in the west so that they lay opposed to each other across the earth, the sun whitehot and the moon a pale replica, as if they were the ends of a common bore beyond whose terminals burned worlds past all reckoning._" The text is pregnant with symbolism; burning trees, dormant volcanoes, and dying horses. Landscapes are so evocatively described that one might wonder whether some information theoretical limit has been broken; how does one's mind see so much, having read so little?
