"Malignantly useless"—that is what life is, Ligotti would have you believe, with his beautiful and disturbing treatise on the tragedy of human consciousness. However, in the best Gödelian fashion, the work fails to address its own beauty, thereby leaving those of us inappropriately fond of life with a way out of woe. Indeed, why would such an ugly thesis read so beautifully? Perhaps the meaning lies not in what the text says, but in what it feels like to read it ... or perhaps this very notion is but a desperate mental concoction of a person unwilling to fully accept Ligotti's bleak truths.
