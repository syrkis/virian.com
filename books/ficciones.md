Ficciones operates like a series of elegant mathematical proofs whose conclusions somehow consistently manages to be both inevitable and impossible. Take "The Book of Sand"â€”what begins as an enecdote reveals the inherent madness of the space of thought. Throughout the collection, Borges performs a disqueting move: he uses academic footnotes and scholarly references (many invented) to create a scaffold of believability, then uses that very scaffold to question the nature of reality. The effect is vertigo-inducing - like discovering that the ground you're standing on is actually the ceiling of another world.
