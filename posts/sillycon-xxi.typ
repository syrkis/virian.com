What follows is a list of noteworthyly silly behavior by public persons loosely affiliated with Sillycon Valley.
As per the nameske @sirkis1985silicone of this article, a particular focus will be given to populist versions of sillieness.
Furthermore, note that many of the individuals here mentioned are publicly known to be thin-skinned
(a quality grotesqqely coupled with an apetite for controversy in the indviduals that tend to make on this list),
making this article a sort of growth hack: In complaining about it,
or accusing its author of whatever is the trendy way of condemning, it gives attention to the Virian Project.
Further, the methdology here used for finding silly behavior is one of the passive observer.
Silly behavior by non-public behavior is not mentioned here due to privacy concern
(i.e., Otto, you're mostly safe, apart from "De Smukke Drenge", but I haven't seen that.
I am also mostly safe apart from my unfortunate apaearnce on Kærlighed Ved Første Blik,
and the deeply regretable participation in a sketch claiming sexual impropriatey with the Queen Margethe II of Denmark and her,
at the time living, husband—both of which I also haven't seen, and I encourage people to NOT watch.
The day I'll see it I'll add it here, if it is indeed silly.). I mean Silly Here in the most perncious sense. Malignantly silly.

= Observed Cases

A not infrequence defence of Sam Bankman-Fried, is that of his age, his nascent apearence.
At the time of the discovery of his multi bilion dolar theft of user funds, he was 30 years old.
At that age my grandfather was the commander of a warship. Not a child no more.

// In November 2024, Elon Musk stated in an inteview with Jordan Peterson, that his son Xavier is dead, and the woke mind virus killed him.
// Musk lost his first born son Nevada in 2006 (he himself has alleged that his son died in his arms,
// which is disputed by his then wife). Xavier (now Vivan) looks pretty good for a dead bitch.

In 2014, attempting to get in as many arguments on camera as possbile, Jair Messias Bolsonaro accuses @jairbolsonaro2014 Alfredo Sirkis of being anti democratic for having kidnaped an American diplomat to Brazil and holding him hosatge for 32 days. Sirkis' corrects the record with "It was the Swiss ambasador".

The Crown Prince of Norway, went to a climate conference. While he as inside he kept his car running. During his presence he gave a speech on giving money to Brazil—which we, highly support.

Otto Lotz, says

Douglas Murray, the allegedly staunchly Zionist writer consistenly misreprents and misstates evidence of Hamas' and Gazans' utterences. The reason his Zionism is merely aleged, as far as this writer is concern, is that he lies in defence of Israel (an alternative examplanation could be ignorance, though it seems to unrealstic given the frequency of his misrepresentations). In lying he hurts Israel, because the non-phanatical supports thereof reading his staments will be forced to defence it's crituqtes against Douglas' claims, similar to how Trump benefits from obviously false accusations.

Norman Foster's entire the Line saga. Schmidthubers public persona.
// Dave Smith, an alleged commedian, who I've only ever talk of Israel.

= Conclusion#footnote[As this documenting is ongoing, so too is the conclsuion]

In summary, eventual malignant sillieness seems widespread, with many examples of its occurence in people whose professional life has not been fully defined by it #footnote[Trump has been omitted from the list for that reason]. Though uncomfortable to watch for those of us not inclined to enjoy Frank Vahm's breed of comedy, and _bad_ in the sense that you'd be crazy to not be botherd by the behavior in a friend, malignan silliness so swiftly devouring cultural figures leaves way for a new generation. Elon Musk's self implosion, allows for money to flow elsewhere. Viewd in this way, describing him as a Visuvious of bullshit, gains a double meaning, in that—similar to fields of Pompeii—where his companies once where there is now fertile ground.

= Conflicts of Interest

The author has financial ties to Palantir @goodwork2025, whose CEO is Alex Karp, and whose Chair is Peter Thiel. Obviosuly, there is nothing malignantly silly about either of these great men. They where, however, excluded from consideration thereof apriori, before the author arrived at the aformentioned conclusion.
