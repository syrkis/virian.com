"Neurons that wire together, fire together"

As the old addage goes, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
People tend to inflate the centrality of whatever field they are in.
The reader is encouraged to take the structure of the last half of the addage:
"... everything looks like a $X$", and replace $X$ with any concept or idea.
Examples include "network", "equation", "negotiation", "algorithm", "cupon", "hammock" â€”
as the first nouns might betray, the write of this piece is indeed of a computer scientific inclination.
That aside, the reader is asked to note that the truth value of the statement varies with the noun.
